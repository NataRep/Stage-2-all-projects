## Reflections

### 1. Getting Started with TypeScript

In the first module, I learned the main advantage of TS over JS: Thanks to static type checking, TypeScript detects problems in the code early in the development process.
I also learned how to install the TypeScript compiler in VS Code.

### 2. Declare Variable Types in TypeScript

In this module, I learned about the data types in TS.
They are divided into:

1.  Primitives:

- boolean
- number
- string
- enum
- void
- null
- undefined

2.  Object type

- —Ålass
- interfaces
- array
- literals

3.  Type parametrs.

Also in this module I learned about syntax declaration of variables using data types.
This knowledge enables me to start translating my code simply from JS to TS.

### 3. Implement interfaces in TypeScript

In this module, I learned:

1.  Interfaces are used to describe objects, their parameters, and property data types.
2.  An interface does not create an object, it only describes a type.
3.  Interfaces can be used to create abbreviated names for commonly used types.
4.  An interface can give you a clear understanding of what a function expects and what it will return, without having to refer to the documentation again.
5.  The difference between an interface and a type :

    - a type alias cannot be reopened to add new properties, whereas an interface can always be extended
    - a type alias can only describe a union or tuple.

6.  Syntax for declaring an interface.
7.  How to extend an interface.
8.  How to declare an interface with custom array types.

### 4. Develop typed functions by using TypeScript

In this module I learned:

1. That declaring argument data types in a function helps to avoid unnecessary input data validation code in the function body.
   Output validation works the same way. I see this as a benefit of using TS. If I forget to do data type checking in js, there will be an error, whereas the typescript will point it out to me during development.
   Also, it is convenient to work with functions that have already specified argument data types, because the IDE will prompt me when I use the function later.
2. The syntax for declaring named, anonymous and arrow functions, and for specifying the type of arguments and output data.
3. The difference between declaring function arguments in TS and JS. In TS, all function parameters are mandatory unless otherwise specified.
4. How to write an optional function parameter and how to pass an unlimited number of parameters to a function in the remaining parameters array.
5. How to use object destructuring as a function argument in a TS function call.
6. How to define function types using type aliases or interfaces.

This knowledge will help me when writing functions with ts. It is a pity that I have not yet understood how to pass random functions to the wrapper (decorator) if the type or interface of the callback is not known beforehand.

### 5. Declare and instantiate classes in TypeScript

In this module, I learned:

1. Learned how to declare a class using TypeScript.

- Parameters can be mandatory or optional, have default values. As with all TypeScript functions, this is the main difference from JS.
- You can set the Access Modifier for properties and methods of a class:
  'public' - The default value is public. The property is accessible from anywhere in the code
  'private' - The property cannot be accessed from outside the class containing it.
  'protected' - acts in the same way as the private modifier, except that members declared as protected can be accessed inside derived classes.
  'readonly' - read-only properties can be set only during initialisation at their declaration or in the constructor.
- Static class properties available without creating an object are set using the 'static' keyword

2. Learned how to instantiate a class using TypeScript.
3. Learned how to extend another class using 'extends' keyword.
4. Learned how and why to declare an interface to provide the form of a class using the 'implements' keyword
5. Learned to distinguish when it is better to use an interface or a class to define the structure of an object:

- When to use an interface:
  Interfaces only define the structure of the data, not the behaviour of the object.
  The main advantage of interfaces is that they are weightless, don't stay in the js code and have a purely service purpose.
  Where I will use interfaces:

  - To define parameter objects for functions,
  - to define structure for various framework properties.
  - and to define what objects look like from remote services or APIs.
    An interface can be used in a common module for client and server code, ensuring that the data structure is the same on both sides.

- When to use Classes
  When you need a template to create objects that can define methods and properties.

### 6.Define generics in TypeScript

In this module, I learned about generics, which allow you to create components with multiple data types, depending on the context of the call.
The syntax of generics components is: somthing <T>(value:T):T{ return T}.
It turns out that the capital letter in the quotes, is just a variable for the data type.
Generics can be:

1. functions:

```javascript
function GenericFunction<T>(value: T): T {
  return T;
}
```

2. interfaces:

```javascript
interface GenericInterfaceForObg<T> {
  value: T
  getIdentity: () => T
}

interface GenericInterfaceForFunction<T>{
  (arg: T): T;
}
```

3. classes:

```javascript
class GenericClass<T> {
  value: T;
}
```

I also learned that in order for generics to work correctly, generic constraints can be used.
They allow you to limit the possible input data types. To do this, you can use type extensions and type checks in the body of the component (typof for primitives and instanceof for objects).
Syntax example:

```javascript
type ExemplType = 'string' | 'value';

function identity<T extends ExemplType, U> (arg1: T, arg2: U):T {
  if(typof arg1 === 'string' ){
    .............
  } else if (typeof value === 'number') {
    .............
  }
}
```

### 7.Access external libraries from TypeScript

In TS, you can use ES6 module syntax and compile to the right synatxis to support older browsers.
If the imported modules have the correct types, there should be no problems. You can import any entities: variables, functions, classes, custom types, and interfaces.
The difficulty arises when importing external libraries without predefined data types.
For many libraries you can use the DefinitelyTyped project. You need to check if the project supports the required library, and then install the package via npm:

```javascript
npm install --save-dev @types/<library-name>
```

### 8. Organize code using TypeScript namespaces

A namespace is a special way to organise code in TS.
A namespace is defined using the namespace keyword and its arbitrary capitalised name.
To use the functionality contained within a namespace, it must be exported using the export keyword and called as a method or property of the namespace object NamespaceName.NameFunction().
Namespaces can be nested. Namespace files can be linked using:

```javascript
/// <reference path="file.ts" />
```

Namespace files can be compiled into different files or a single file, depending on the compiler settings.
It helps to separate scopes for variables and put them in a scope.
Since JS (ES6) now supports modules, there is no need to use namespaces in new projects. That's why I don't plan to use namespaces in my code.
