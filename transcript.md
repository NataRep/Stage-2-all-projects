**1 What is Angular**

Hello! Today we are going to talk about Angular - a modern framework for building web applications.

We will look at how Angular helps developers build powerful and interactive web interfaces.

**2 History**

Let's take a look at the history of Angular's development.

In 2009, Misko Heveri and Adam Abrons - a duo of engineers from Google - set a mission to create AngularJS, familiar to us as a pioneering JavaScript framework. The release of this brainchild took place in the following year, 2010.

But by 2016, the authors completely reworked the idea of the framework and released Angular. Unlike its predecessor, it was based on TS and met modern web development requirements.

**3 Intro in Angular**

Let's take a look at the main features of Angular.

**1. Powerful Framework** is the modern framework for building complex web applications. It provides developers with the tools and structure they need to create high-performance and scalable web applications.

**2. Architecture and Performance:** Angular offers a component-based architecture, powerful optimisation tools and an extensive set of features for creating

**3. TypeScript:** is based on TypeScript, which helps improve code performance and stability through strict typing and other TypeScript features.

**4. Ecosystem and community:** Angular has a vibrant developer community and an extensive ecosystem of tools and libraries, making it an attractive choice for a wide range of projects and companies

**4 Angular's core concepts**

Here are the basic concepts that are important to understand when working with Angular:

**Modules:**

- Modules are used to organise Angular code. They are groups of components and/or services that are linked together.
- Each Angular application consists of one or more modules that contain components, directives, services, and other resources.

Below we will familiarise ourselves with these terms.

**Components:**

- The basic building blocks of an application in Angular are components.
- Components are parts of the user interface that combine HTML template (Templates), TypeScript logic (Ð¡ontroller and View), and styles.

**Services:**

- Services provide common functionality available to different components of an application.
- They are used to execute business logic, access data from APIs, interact with the server, and other tasks.
- They are a singleton object that is created only once during the life of the application.
- It is a class used to store the global state of the application or as a data provider.
- Angular services can be defined at the application, module or component level.\*\*

**Directives:**

Angular directives are used to change the appearance or behaviour of a DOM element. There are three types of directives:

- With their own template, or differently components (components are directives);
- Structural, which change the structure of the DOM tree;
- Attributes, which change the default appearance or behaviour of a DOM tree element.\*\*

**Templates:**

- Each component defines its own HTML template that defines how the model data will be displayed to the user.
- Angular templates support data binding, directives, and conditional statements, making them a powerful tool for creating dynamic interfaces.

**Dependency Injection:**

- The Angular core has its own implementation of the Dependency Injection pattern
- Angular uses a dependency injection mechanism to give components access to services and other dependencies.

**6 Benefits of using Angular:**

What are the benefits of using Angular for developers?

**1. Modularity:**

- Angular supports a modular architecture that allows you to break your application into independent and reusable modules.
- Modules simplify code organisation and make it easy to maintain and scale your application.

**2. Code Reusability:**

- Angular's component-based architecture encourages the creation of overused components.
- Developers can efficiently use components in different parts of the application, reducing development time and improving overall code quality.

**3. Dependency Management:**

- Angular uses a dependency injection mechanism to provide components with the services they need.
- This allows you to create loosely coupled and easily testable components, simplifying dependency injection and ensuring ease of development.

**4. Extensive Testing Capabilities:**

- Angular provides built-in testing tools, including the Angular Testing Library and TestBed.
- This makes it easy to write and run unit, integration, and unit tests for components, services, and other parts of your application.

**5. Efficient HTTP and Networking:**

- Angular provides an HTTP client to make HTTP requests to the server.
- Using the HttpClientModule and the HttpClient service, developers can easily interact with the server, process data, and manage the state of the application.
- With Angular Interceptors, it is easy to add functionality to handle request processing

**7 Angular tools and ecosystem:**

Angular offers an extensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and resources that help developers build powerful and modern web applications. Here are some of the key components of the Angular ecosystem:

1. **Angular CLI (Command Line Interface):**

Angular CLI is the official command line tool for creating, deploying and managing Angular projects.

It allows you to quickly create components, modules, services, and run various build and test scenarios.

1. **Angular Material:**

Angular Material is a library of UI components designed specifically for Angular.

It provides ready-made components (buttons, forms, tables, modal windows and others) with attractive design and easy customisation.

1. **RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript):**

RxJS is a library for working with asynchronous and event-driven programs based on the reactive programming pattern.

Angular includes RxJS in its toolkit for processing data streams, managing state, and handling asynchronous operations.

1. **Angular Universal:**

Angular Universal allows server-side rendering of Angular applications to improve SEO and performance.

This allows you to create universal (isomorphic) applications that can run on both server and client.

These tools and libraries are just a part of the vast Angular ecosystem, which is constantly evolving thanks to an active developer community. Using these tools simplifies development, improves performance, and enriches the functionality of Angular web applications.

**8 Examples of using Angular:**

Here are some examples of real-world projects and applications using Angular:

1. **Google Ads**

- Google Ads, one of the largest advertising platforms in the world, uses Angular to build its interface and dashboard.
- Angular allows for high performance and usability when working with huge amounts of data and functionality.

1. ` `**Gmail**

- As a single-page app, Gmail, which has over 1.5 billion users, now sports a simple interface and offers a seamless experience for its users, making it an easy to use and more efficient platform.
- The user-oriented app renders data on its front-end, thereby enabling access to cached data in the offline regime.All these improved features are a result of the Angular framework, thanks to its out-of-the-box module.

1. **PayPal**

- PayPal, one of the largest payment providers, uses Angular to develop its user interface.
- Angular helps ensure security, reliability, and performance when processing transactions and managing user accounts.

1. **Upwork**

- Upwork, an online platform for finding freelancers and clients, uses Angular to build its web application.
- Angular helps provide a dynamic interface and usability when working with different types of user data.

1. **Forbes**

- Forbes, a large media portal, uses Angular for its web application.
- Angular allows you to create interactive and scalable web pages with fast response and good performance.

1. **YouTube TV**

- YouTube TV provides access to a range of live programmes.
- Thanks to the Angular framework, it is available for most brands of TVs and is compatible with LG and Samsung, as well as other smart TVs.
- The Angular framework provides access to YouTube TV without multiple decoders, saving a lot of data and synchronising with existing TV brands.

**The End:**

These examples demonstrate a wide range of applications of Angular in real-world projects of different scales and directions. Using Angular allows developers to create modern, powerful, and performant web applications for a variety of fields.
