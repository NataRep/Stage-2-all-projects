## Reflections

### 1. Getting Started with TypeScript

In the first module, I learned the main advantage of TS over JS: Thanks to static type checking, TypeScript detects problems in the code early in the development process.
I also learned how to install the TypeScript compiler in VS Code.

### 2. Declare Variable Types in TypeScript

In this module, I learned about the data types in TS.
They are divided into:

1.  Primitives:

- boolean
- number
- string
- enum
- void
- null
- undefined

2.  Object type

- —Ålass
- interfaces
- array
- literals

3.  Type parametrs.

Also in this module I learned about syntax declaration of variables using data types.
This knowledge enables me to start translating my code simply from JS to TS.

### 3. Implement interfaces in TypeScript

In this module, I learned:

1.  Interfaces are used to describe objects, their parameters, and property data types.
2.  An interface does not create an object, it only describes a type.
3.  Interfaces can be used to create abbreviated names for commonly used types.
4.  An interface can give you a clear understanding of what a function expects and what it will return, without having to refer to the documentation again.
5.  The difference between an interface and a type :

    - a type alias cannot be reopened to add new properties, whereas an interface can always be extended
    - a type alias can only describe a union or tuple.

6.  Syntax for declaring an interface.
7.  How to extend an interface.
8.  How to declare an interface with custom array types.

### 4. Develop typed functions by using TypeScript
