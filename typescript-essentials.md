## Reflections

### 1. Getting Started with TypeScript

In the first module, I learned the main advantage of TS over JS: Thanks to static type checking, TypeScript detects problems in the code early in the development process.
I also learned how to install the TypeScript compiler in VS Code.

### 2. Declare Variable Types in TypeScript

In this module, I learned about the data types in TS.
They are divided into:

1.  Primitives:

- boolean
- number
- string
- enum
- void
- null
- undefined

2.  Object type

- —Ålass
- interfaces
- array
- literals

3.  Type parametrs.

Also in this module I learned about syntax declaration of variables using data types.
This knowledge enables me to start translating my code simply from JS to TS.

### 3. Implement interfaces in TypeScript

In this module, I learned:

1.  Interfaces are used to describe objects, their parameters, and property data types.
2.  An interface does not create an object, it only describes a type.
3.  Interfaces can be used to create abbreviated names for commonly used types.
4.  An interface can give you a clear understanding of what a function expects and what it will return, without having to refer to the documentation again.
5.  The difference between an interface and a type :

    - a type alias cannot be reopened to add new properties, whereas an interface can always be extended
    - a type alias can only describe a union or tuple.

6.  Syntax for declaring an interface.
7.  How to extend an interface.
8.  How to declare an interface with custom array types.

### 4. Develop typed functions by using TypeScript

In this module I learned:

1. That declaring argument data types in a function helps to avoid unnecessary input data validation code in the function body.
   Output validation works the same way. I see this as a benefit of using TS. If I forget to do data type checking in js, there will be an error, whereas the typescript will point it out to me during development.
   Also, it is convenient to work with functions that have already specified argument data types, because the IDE will prompt me when I use the function later.
2. The syntax for declaring named, anonymous and arrow functions, and for specifying the type of arguments and output data.
3. The difference between declaring function arguments in TS and JS. In TS, all function parameters are mandatory unless otherwise specified.
4. How to write an optional function parameter and how to pass an unlimited number of parameters to a function in the remaining parameters array.
5. How to use object destructuring as a function argument in a TS function call.
6. How to define function types using type aliases or interfaces.

This knowledge will help me when writing functions with ts. It is a pity that I have not yet understood how to pass random functions to the wrapper (decorator) if the type or interface of the callback is not known beforehand.

### 5. Declare and instantiate classes in TypeScript

In this module, I learned:

1. Learned how to declare a class using TypeScript.

- Parameters can be mandatory or optional, have default values. As with all TypeScript functions, this is the main difference from JS.
- You can set the Access Modifier for properties and methods of a class:
  public - The default value is public. The property is accessible from anywhere in the code
  private - The property cannot be accessed from outside the class containing it.
  protected - acts in the same way as the private modifier, except that members declared as protected can be accessed inside derived classes.
  readonly - read-only properties can be set only during initialisation at their declaration or in the constructor.
- Static class properties available without creating an object are set using the static keyword

2. Learned how to instantiate a class using TypeScript.
3. Learned how to extend another class using extends keyword.
4. Learned how and why to declare an interface to provide the form of a class using the implements keyword
5. Learned to distinguish when it is better to use an interface or a class to define the structure of an object:

- When to use an interface:
  Interfaces only define the structure of the data, not the behaviour of the object.
  The main advantage of interfaces is that they are weightless, don't stay in the js code and have a purely service purpose.
  Where I will use interfaces:

  - To define parameter objects for functions,
  - to define structure for various framework properties.
  - and to define what objects look like from remote services or APIs.
    An interface can be used in a common module for client and server code, ensuring that the data structure is the same on both sides.

- When to use Classes
  When you need a template to create objects that can define methods and properties.
  And also when you need to use class extension through inheritance.
