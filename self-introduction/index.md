## Hello!

My name is Nata, I am 35 years old.
I am from Vladimir, Russia.
I want to become a frontend developer.

It so happened that I got a pedagogical education (Vladimir Pedagogical College), but I've been working in IT for over 10 years.

Initially, I worked as an SEO analyst in a web studio.
After working there for three years, I wanted to do more than just write technical tasks for others, I wanted to learn how websites work from the inside.
So I left the web studio. I learnt html, css and how to make websites on CMS Joomla and Wordpress. I began to create and promote websites on freelancing.

But I realized that my sites are far from perfect.
Two years ago, I took a UI-design course to make my sites more visually appealing.
However, I soon discovered that I don’t want to create another Wordpress site. Moreover, one-person development really bored me a lot.

As a result, I decided to learn frontend development and join a team.

In last year, I completed the Frontend Stage 0 course at RS School. It was very interesting. Especially, the last task with a random game. I worked with canvas for the first time and made the Snake Game.
Then I progressed to Stage 1.

I've even got a dream pet project.
I would like to create a web application to teach juggling.
With following features:

- A map of the order in which the tricks are learned.
- Step-by-step lessons for each trick with animations of balls flight and hand movements.
- Learning progress
- And the ability to upload short videos of mastered tricks and share them on social networks.
- Also, there will be a cute mascot, Penguin John, who will show you all the tricks in animations.

For me, programming is like juggling, it requires paying attention to detail and manipulating different elements. If I get distracted and lose sight of something, everything will fall down.

Thank you for your time. Goodbye!
